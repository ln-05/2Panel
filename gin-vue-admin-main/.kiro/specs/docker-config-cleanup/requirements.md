# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up the dockerConfig directory structure by removing unnecessary files and organizing the Docker configuration management functionality into a clean, maintainable structure. The goal is to keep only the essential configuration management pages and remove redundant or unused components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up the dockerConfig directory structure, so that the codebase is organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the dockerConfig directory THEN the system SHALL identify unnecessary files and components
2. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL preserve the main configuration management functionality
3. WHEN reorganizing THEN the system SHALL maintain a clear separation between different configuration aspects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to keep only the essential Docker configuration management pages, so that the interface is clean and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL preserve the main index.vue configuration page
2. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove redundant test files and unused components
3. WHEN organizing THEN the system SHALL ensure the remaining files serve distinct purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize Docker configuration into logical sub-pages, so that different aspects of configuration management are properly separated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating sub-pages THEN the system SHALL separate backup management from main configuration
2. WHEN organizing functionality THEN the system SHALL create distinct pages for service management
3. WHEN structuring THEN the system SHALL ensure each page has a specific, non-overlapping purpose

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused components and files, so that the project structure is clean and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying files THEN the system SHALL remove components that are not referenced
2. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate functionality
3. WHEN organizing THEN the system SHALL ensure all remaining files are actively used
